# Pollenkontrollen

This is a Progressive Web App that displays pollen forecasts from several stations in Sweden. It can be viewed on the web or installed to the homescreen like a normal app and also works offline by caching assets and api responses. It is built using Angular CLI and uses Angular Material for its UI components.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
